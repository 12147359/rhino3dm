### [Use compute to get isocurves and meshes](https://mcneel.github.io/rhino3dm/javascript/samples/compute/brep_isocurves/index.html)

Loads a 3dm file containing the Rhino logo as a brep, fetches the render mesh and wireframe and loads them into a [three.js](https://threejs.org) scene.

### [boolean.html](https://mcneel.github.io/rhino3dm/javascript/samples/compute/brep_boolean/index.html)

As rhinologo.html but also loads another set of breps and calculates the boolean difference between the Rhino logo and these.

### [ar.html](https://mcneel.github.io/rhino3dm/javascript/samples/viewer/03_ar/index.html)

Print the [hiro marker](https://jeromeetienne.github.io/AR.js/data/images/HIRO.jpg) (or simply open it on your computer screen) then open this sample on a mobile phone and point the camera at the marker.

## [clash_detection](https://mcneel.github.io/rhino3dm/javascript/samples/compute/clash_detection/)

Performs clash detection between a bunch of randomly positioned spheres and one main sphere.
