.. py:module:: rhino3dm

.. py:class:: Texture

   .. py:method:: Texture()

      Texture constructor


   .. py:attribute:: FileName

      str: Gets or sets a file name that is used by this texture.
      NOTE: We are moving away from string-based FileName, and suggest
      the usage of the new FileReference class.Also, this filename may well not be a path that makes sense
      on a user's computer because it was a path initially set on
      a different user's computer. If you want to get a workable path
      for this user, use the BitmapTable.Find function using this
      property.

   .. py:method:: FileReference()

      [todo] add documentation
