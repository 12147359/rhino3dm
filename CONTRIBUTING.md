## Contributing to rhino3dm

#### Reporting Bugs and Requesting Features

* We do not use github issues, but instead track all bugs and feature requests through the [McNeel YouTrack Application](https://mcneel.myjetbrains.com/youtrack/issues?q=project:%20Rhino3dm)
* Feel free to add issues under the "Rhino3dm" project for any bug you may find or feature you would like to see added.

#### Fixing bugs and adding Features

* Open a new GitHub pull request with your changes.

* Please try to keep your pull request focused on a specific feature or bug. A single PR with a bunch of changes is much harder to review than many smaller and focused PRs.

* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant YouTrack issue number if applicable.

* Try to follow the coding conventions even they aren't your personal "style". Having all of the code look the same in general makes it easier to read.

#### Do you have questions about the source code?

* The best place to discuss the project is through our [discourse site](https://discourse.mcneel.com/) under the rhino3dm category

#### AND FINALLY
